# WeatherService sample project using DDD, CQRS and onion architecture

This project is a sample of how to use the Dapper.DDD.Repository library. Furthermore it's fully fledged using [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [CQRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation) and [Onion architecture](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Onion_Architecture).

If you're not familiar with these concepts I'd recommend starting out with the [WeatherService Simplified](https://github.com/steffenskov/Dapper.DDD.Repository/tree/main/samples/WeatherService-Simplified) project instead.
