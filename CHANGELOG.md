## [Unreleased]

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- Added two overloads for Dependency injection offering the use of a custom configuration type for Table and View repositories respectively.
	- This can be useful if you want to add extra configuration to your repos and don't want to deal with the overload taking a constructor delegate.
